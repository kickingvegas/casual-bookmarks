* Casual Bookmarks
An opinionated [[https://github.com/magit/transient][Transient]]-based user interface for the Emacs [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Bookmarks.html][Bookmark]] list.

[[file:docs/images/casual-bookmarks-screenshot.png]]

* Motivation
While highly functional, the Emacs bookmark list (~list-bookmarks~) has a steep learning curve as it has a very diverse command set. Menus are a user interface (UI) affordance that offer users discoverability and recall that can lower its learning curve. While menus are commonly associated with mouse-driven UI, the inclusion of Transient in Emacs core allows for a menu UI that is keyboard-driven. Casual Bookmarks endeavors to offer this as many Emacs users prefer keyboard-driven workflows.

** Goals
- To provide a keyboard-driven menu UI for editing bookmarks.
- To provide casual access to the Bookmark list command set.

** Non-Goals
- Full coverage of all bookmark list commands. Casual Bookmarks is not intended to be a power user tool.
- Strict adherence to bookmark list command naming. While Casual Bookmarks is *mostly* in alignment with bookmark list command naming, there are cases where it will make an opinionated change if the name is deemed too vague or idiomatic.
- UX Stability (for now). Given that Casual Bookmarks is early in its life-cycle, expect changes to its user experience in terms of menu hierarchy and keybinding choices in future releases.

* Requirements
Casual Bookmarks requires usage of
- Emacs ≥ 29.1
- Casual Lib ≥ 1.1.0

Casual Bookmarks has been verified with the following configuration. 
- Emacs 29.4 (macOS 14.5, Ubuntu Linux 22.04.4 LTS)

* Asks
As Casual Bookmarks is new, we are looking for early adopters! Your [[https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual-bookmarks/discussions][feedback]] is welcome as it will likely impact Casual Bookmarks's evolution, particularly with regards to UI.

* Install
If installed via MELPA then add these lines to your Emacs initialization file with your binding of preference. 
#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (require 'casual-bookmarks) ;; optional
  (keymap-set bookmark-bmenu-mode-map "C-o" #'casual-bookmarks-tmenu)
#+end_src

If you use ~use-package~, here is the recipe for installing and configuring it.
#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (use-package bookmark
    :ensure nil
    :defer t)
  (use-package casual-bookmarks
    :ensure t
    :bind (:map bookmark-bmenu-mode-map
                ("C-o" . casual-bookmarks-tmenu)
                ("S" . casual-bookmarks-sortby-tmenu)
                ("J" . bookmark-jump))
    :after (bookmark))
#+end_src


** A Note on Package Dependencies
Casual Bookmarks requires Casual Lib which in turn requires a recent installation of Transient 0.6.0+ from either [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/transient.html][ELPA]] or [[https://melpa.org/#/transient][MELPA]]. As an older version of Transient is built-in to the Emacs release, the package manager ~package.el~ will /not/ update this package unless the customizable variable ~package-install-upgrade-built-in~ is set to ~t~. Set this variable and proceed with installing Casual Bookmarks. Alternately invoking ~package-install~ with a prefix (~C-u~) will temporarily coerce the update of the built-in package. (example: ~C-u M-x package-install~ ~casual-bookmarks~)

As Transient is closely tied to Magit, installing the latest version of Magit (via [[https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/magit.html][non-GNU ELPA]] or [[https://melpa.org/#/magit][MELPA]]) before installing Casual Bookmarks can also pick up the latest version of Transient.

** Configuration
Use these keybindings to configure bookmark list to be consistent with keybindings used by Casual Bookmarks.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (keymap-set bookmark-bmenu-mode-map "J" #'bookmark-jump)
#+end_src

Casual Bookmarks also includes the keymap ~casual-bookmarks-main-menu~ which inserts a /Bookmarks/ menu into the main menu bar as shown below.

[[file:docs/images/bookmarks-main-menu.png]]

To enable this, add the following configuration to your initialization file.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (require 'casual-bookmarks)
  (easy-menu-add-item global-map '(menu-bar)
                      casual-bookmarks-main-menu
                      "Tools")
#+end_src

While not necessary, having the current bookmark highlighted is convenient. Enable  ~hl-line-mode~ for the bookmark list as shown below.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (require 'hl-line)
  (add-hook 'bookmark-bmenu-mode-hook #'hl-line-mode)
#+end_src

Finally, customize the variable ~bookmark-save-flag~ to the value ~1~ to ensure that your bookmark changes are always saved.

The above guidance largely extends the work done in the blog post [[http://yummymelon.com/devnull/using-bookmarks-in-emacs-like-you-do-in-web-browsers.html][Using Bookmarks in Emacs like you do in Web Browsers]]. 

* Usage

** Unicode Symbol Support
[[file:docs/images/casual-bookmarks-unicode-screenshot.png]]

By enabling “Use Unicode Symbols” from the Settings menu, Casual Bookmarks will use Unicode symbols as appropriate in its menus. The following mapping is shown in the table below:

| Name                 | Plain     | Unicode |
|----------------------+-----------+---------|
| :previous            | Previous  | ↑       |
| :next                | Next      | ↓       |
| :jump                | Jump      | 🚀     |
| :beginning-of-buffer | Beginning | ⤒      |
| :end-of-buffer       | End       | ⤓      |
| :backward            | Backward  | ←       |
| :forward             | Forward   | →       |
| :narrow              | Narrow    | →←      |
| :widen               | Widen     | ←→      |

* Common Menu Actions
Casual Bookmarks is built using Transient menus and as such adopts much of its default behavior.

Each menu item has a /key/ and a /label/. The /key/ is what is typed by the user to select the menu item. A key can be prefixed with a meta (M-) or control (C-) key. 

Dismissing a menu regardless of how deep you are in sub-menus can be done by entering ~C-q~. A menu can also be dismissed by entering ~C-g~, but this will return you to the parent menu.

If a mouse is available, a menu item can be selected by moving the mouse cursor over its label and pressing down button 1.

Pressing the ~?~ key will toggle help for all the menu items. Press the key of interest to get help for it.

When a Transient menu is raised, a prefix argument (~C-u~) can be entered before selecting a menu item.
