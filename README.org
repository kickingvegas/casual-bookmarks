* NOTICE

This package has been superseded by the package [[https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual][casual]]. Please install the package ~casual~ from either [[https://melpa.org/#/casual][MELPA]] or [[https://stable.melpa.org/#/casual][MELPA stable]].

Upon installation and upgrade of ~casual~, this package will be uninstalled from your Emacs configuration. Please revisit your configuration of Casual Bookmarks in your initialization file(s) accordingly.

This repository should be treated as an archive. All future development on Casual Bookmarks will be done in the [[https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual][Casual repository]].


* Casual Bookmarks
An opinionated [[https://github.com/magit/transient][Transient]]-based user interface for the Emacs [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Bookmarks.html][Bookmark]] list.

[[file:docs/images/casual-bookmarks-screenshot.png]]

* Motivation
While highly functional, the Emacs bookmark list (~list-bookmarks~) has a steep learning curve as it has a very diverse command set. Menus are a user interface (UI) affordance that offer users discoverability and recall that can lower its learning curve. While menus are commonly associated with mouse-driven UI, the inclusion of Transient in Emacs core allows for a menu UI that is keyboard-driven. Casual Bookmarks endeavors to offer this as many Emacs users prefer keyboard-driven workflows.

** Goals
- To provide a keyboard-driven menu UI for editing bookmarks.
- To provide casual access to the Bookmark list command set.

** Non-Goals
- Full coverage of all bookmark list commands. Casual Bookmarks is not intended to be a power user tool.
- Strict adherence to bookmark list command naming. While Casual Bookmarks is *mostly* in alignment with bookmark list command naming, there are cases where it will make an opinionated change if the name is deemed too vague or idiomatic.
- UX Stability (for now). Given that Casual Bookmarks is early in its life-cycle, expect changes to its user experience in terms of menu hierarchy and keybinding choices in future releases.

* Requirements
Casual Bookmarks requires usage of
- Emacs ‚â• 29.1
- Casual Lib ‚â• 1.1.0

Casual Bookmarks has been verified with the following configuration. 
- Emacs 29.4 (macOS 14.5, Ubuntu Linux 22.04.4 LTS)

* Asks
As Casual Bookmarks is new, we are looking for early adopters! Your [[https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual-bookmarks/discussions][feedback]] is welcome as it will likely impact Casual Bookmarks's evolution, particularly with regards to UI.

* Install
If installed via MELPA then add these lines to your Emacs initialization file with your binding of preference. 
#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (require 'casual-bookmarks) ;; optional
  (keymap-set bookmark-bmenu-mode-map "C-o" #'casual-bookmarks-tmenu)
#+end_src

If you use ~use-package~, here is the recipe for installing and configuring it.
#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (use-package bookmark
    :ensure nil
    :defer t)
  (use-package casual-bookmarks
    :ensure t
    :bind (:map bookmark-bmenu-mode-map
                ("C-o" . casual-bookmarks-tmenu)
                ("S" . casual-bookmarks-sortby-tmenu)
                ("J" . bookmark-jump))
    :after (bookmark))
#+end_src


** A Note on Package Dependencies
Casual Bookmarks requires Casual Lib which in turn requires a recent installation of Transient 0.6.0+ from either [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/transient.html][ELPA]] or [[https://melpa.org/#/transient][MELPA]]. As an older version of Transient is built-in to the Emacs release, the package manager ~package.el~ will /not/ update this package unless the customizable variable ~package-install-upgrade-built-in~ is set to ~t~. Set this variable and proceed with installing Casual Bookmarks. Alternately invoking ~package-install~ with a prefix (~C-u~) will temporarily coerce the update of the built-in package. (example: ~C-u M-x package-install~ ~casual-bookmarks~)

As Transient is closely tied to Magit, installing the latest version of Magit (via [[https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/magit.html][non-GNU ELPA]] or [[https://melpa.org/#/magit][MELPA]]) before installing Casual Bookmarks can also pick up the latest version of Transient.

** Configuration
Use these keybindings to configure bookmark list to be consistent with keybindings used by Casual Bookmarks.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (keymap-set bookmark-bmenu-mode-map "J" #'bookmark-jump)
#+end_src

Casual Bookmarks also includes the keymap ~casual-bookmarks-main-menu~ which inserts a /Bookmarks/ menu into the main menu bar as shown below.

[[file:docs/images/bookmarks-main-menu.png]]

To enable this, add the following configuration to your initialization file.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (require 'casual-bookmarks)
  (easy-menu-add-item global-map '(menu-bar)
                      casual-bookmarks-main-menu
                      "Tools")
#+end_src

While not necessary, having the current bookmark highlighted is convenient. Enable  ~hl-line-mode~ for the bookmark list as shown below.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (require 'hl-line)
  (add-hook 'bookmark-bmenu-mode-hook #'hl-line-mode)
#+end_src

Finally, customize the variable ~bookmark-save-flag~ to the value ~1~ to ensure that your bookmark changes are always saved.

The above guidance largely extends the work done in the blog post [[http://yummymelon.com/devnull/using-bookmarks-in-emacs-like-you-do-in-web-browsers.html][Using Bookmarks in Emacs like you do in Web Browsers]]. 

* Usage

** Unicode Symbol Support
[[file:docs/images/casual-bookmarks-unicode-screenshot.png]]

By enabling ‚ÄúUse Unicode Symbols‚Äù from the Settings menu, Casual Bookmarks will use Unicode symbols as appropriate in its menus. The following mapping is shown in the table below:

| Name                 | Plain     | Unicode |
|----------------------+-----------+---------|
| :previous            | Previous  | ‚Üë       |
| :next                | Next      | ‚Üì       |
| :jump                | Jump      | üöÄ     |
| :beginning-of-buffer | Beginning | ‚§í      |
| :end-of-buffer       | End       | ‚§ì      |
| :backward            | Backward  | ‚Üê       |
| :forward             | Forward   | ‚Üí       |
| :narrow              | Narrow    | ‚Üí‚Üê      |
| :widen               | Widen     | ‚Üê‚Üí      |

* Common Menu Actions
Casual Bookmarks is built using Transient menus and as such adopts much of its default behavior.

Each menu item has a /key/ and a /label/. The /key/ is what is typed by the user to select the menu item. A key can be prefixed with a meta (M-) or control (C-) key. 

Dismissing a menu regardless of how deep you are in sub-menus can be done by entering ~C-q~. A menu can also be dismissed by entering ~C-g~, but this will return you to the parent menu.

If a mouse is available, a menu item can be selected by moving the mouse cursor over its label and pressing down button 1.

Pressing the ~?~ key will toggle help for all the menu items. Press the key of interest to get help for it.

When a Transient menu is raised, a prefix argument (~C-u~) can be entered before selecting a menu item.
